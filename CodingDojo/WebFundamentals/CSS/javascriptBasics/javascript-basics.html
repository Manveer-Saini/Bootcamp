                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-plaform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript
                         is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight
                          language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch
                        of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web
                    browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for
                                storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the
                                 coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                                  with unique names. These unique name are called identifiers,
                                   <span id="variable">varx;</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to 
                                JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, 
                                giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value
                                to a variable, <span id="variable">var x = 10;</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
                             operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data 
                             types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean <span id="variable">true</span> 
                             or <span id="variable">false</span>; null - <span id="variable">null</span> 
                             aka nothing; Number - <span id="variable">42</span> or <span id="variable">
                                 3.14159</span> ; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array -
                              <span id="variable">[1,'Coding',2, 'Dojo']; </span> and Object - 
                              <span id="variable">{first_name:'Jane',last_name;'Doe'} </span></p>
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different
                            decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that
                            have been met. You can use condition statement in your code to accomplish this.
                             There the following conditional statements: <span id="variable">if</span> a 
                             specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; 
                             <span id="variable">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the
                             first condition is false; <span id="variable">else</span> we execute this block
                             of code;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kidns of loops in every programming
                             language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action
                             some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track
                             four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we 
                            call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                             instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea,
                              we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs 
                              to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
                               our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our 
                               function over and over and over again.</p>
                        </li>
